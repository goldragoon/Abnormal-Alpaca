#Purpose

Evaluate hand-written mathematical expression on android appplication.

#Implementation Details

##Pipeline

###Image Processing

###Build Machine Learning Model

-Machine Learning Library

We build our hand-written letter recogition model using **Tensorflow** library.

To predict samples on android environment using tensorflow(on android application, learning process will not be included further after and now...... maybe?), [nightly-android build 465](https://ci.tensorflow.org/view/Nightly/job/nightly-android/465/) version is included in our project.

Our development tool is android studio, and initial setting with [This Article](https://omid.al/posts/2017-02-20-Tutorial-Build-Your-First-Tensorflow-Android-App.html) has no problem to us.
